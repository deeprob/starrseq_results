Our assay design allows us to categorize the regions into multiple groups based on their ko and wt activity. The three strategies to categorize the regions are:

1. Activity of the region in a specific library
2. Differential activity of the region in KO library vs WT library
3. Type of differential activity of the region in KO library vs WT library
4. Activity of the regions across all libraries

Each strategy is described in details below.

# 1. Activity of the region in a specific library (Peaks vs nonpeaks)


# 2. Differential activity of the region in KO library vs WT library (responsive vs nonresponsive)
 

# 3. Type of differential activity of the region in KO library vs WT library (induced vs repressed)


# 4. Activity of the regions across all libraries (constitutive and inactive)
